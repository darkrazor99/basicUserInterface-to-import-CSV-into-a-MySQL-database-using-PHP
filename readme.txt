set up:
pretty much we need some sort of local server set up service I am using xxamp so I have set the default data as the one xxamp
If you are using xxamp and didn't change anything great then this should instantly work without any additional setup
however if you are using a diffrent local server setup or changed in them you need to head to includes/databaseinfo.php
and edit the information and after that its pretty much done just go to localhost in your browser and run the directory with this task
oh don't forget to put this in the root folder of your local server .
